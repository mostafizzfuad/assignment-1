		<h3>A. Read about Mamun's home district.</h3>
		<p>My home district is kishoregonj. It is about <i>145 kilometres</i> from Dhaka. It is a district <b>headquarters.</b> The district has 8 municipalities, 13 upazilas, 108 unions and 1745 villages. The name Kishoreganj comes from the name of an old landloard known as <u>Brojakishore Pramanik or Nandakishore Pramanik.</u> The area of Kishoregonj municipality is about <i>10 square kilometres.</i> The river <b>Narasunda</b> flows through the town.</p>

		<p>Kishoreganj is a small town, but there are many important places in and around it. The largest <b>Eid</b> fairground, called <u>Solakia Eid Ground</u> and the well known <b>Government Gurudayal Collage</b> are in the town. People from many districts come to this place to celebrate <b>Eid.</b> <u>The Pagla Mosque</u> is also in my home district. Outside the town, you can visit the fort of <i>Isah Khan</i> at <b>Jangal Bari.</b> You can also see the <b>Shah Muhammad Mosque</b> at Egaroshindhur. Near the fuleshwari River, you can see the shiva Temple of <b>Chandrabati.</b> </p>

		<p><b>Kishoregonj</b> is also the home district of some famous people. <b>Chandrabati</b> the first woman poet of Bangla literature, was born here. Two writers of <b>children's literature, Upendrakishore Roy Chowdhury and Sukumar Roy</b> are also from here. The great pointer <u><b>Zainul Abedin</b></u> comes from kishoregonj, too. Syed Nazrul Islam, the first acting president of Bangladesh, is also from here. I love my home district.</p>
